# InventoryManagement

This is a project for my coursework, which aimed to develop a versatile database for managing products in a warehouse. The goal was to create a system that could meet all basic requirements for storing, processing, and analyzing data about products, as well as to build a web application with minimalistic design for easy and intuitive interaction with the database.
